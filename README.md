## CONTRIBUTION GUIDELINES

First `FORK` this repo and then make a branch of the component on which you wish to work. This can be done by following:<br />
`git checkout -b <component name>`

This command will make another branch by this name and switch to that branch.<br />
After making the local changes and commits push your changes to the branch on which you are working, by running this command:<br />
`git push -u <component name>`

Then make a Pull Request after the component name that you have worked on.<br />
